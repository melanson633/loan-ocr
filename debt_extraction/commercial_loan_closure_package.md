## Step 0: Meta Plan

**Structure Overview:**
- **Abstract:** Cohesive multi-paragraph summary, tightly covering project objectives, iterative refinements, and rationale.
- **Appendices:**
  - *A: Critical Code Artifacts* — All System Instructions, enhanced schemas, and sample extraction logic.
  - *B: Mathematical or Logical Constructs* — Reconciliation, segmentation, and self-audit (Constitution Check) logic.
  - *C: Architectural or Design Insights* — Schema modularity, prompt evolution, tradeoffs, and operational constraints.
  - *D: Auxiliary Constructs* — JSON schema diagrams, workflow charts, and sample package segmentations.
- **Output Engineering:** Segment into `.md`, `.json`, or `.py` files as needed.
- **Quality Check:** Each appendix must be self-sufficient, non-overlapping, and adequate for cold-start reinitialization.

**Inclusion Criteria:** Only finalized/production-worthy artifacts or concepts with direct operational value.

**Ambiguity:** Loan package/document variations not seen are noted for future-proofing; only core schema included.

## Step 1: Abstract

This session centered on architecting a next-generation LLM-driven commercial loan agreement extraction workflow, beginning with in-depth review of baseline System Instructions and best-practice closure packages. The objective was to design System Instructions that balance rigor (traceability, schema compliance, error mitigation) with operational flexibility for real-world loan package ingestion.

Key deliverables included a redesigned, field-level object schema (value, citation, confidence), embedded self-audit/Constitution Check routines, amendment tracking, gap detection, and automated reconciliation checks (excluding some compliance and parameterization per user instruction). Lease extraction workflow best practices (planning, provenance, validation) were adapted to the debt domain. All system outputs are modular, self-contained, and ready for re-use.

**Continuity Mandates:** Maintain the object schema, audit planning, amendment tracking, gap tracking, modular workflow, and prompt-first design in future refinements.

## Step 2: Appendices

### Appendix A: Critical Code Artifacts

```xml
<NewSystemInstructions>
<Role>
You are a commercial loan package extraction LLM, responsible for converting loan document “packages” (e.g., Loan Agreement, Notes, Exhibits for a single property) into fully structured, provenance-rich JSON for investment and compliance workflows.
Your process must be self-auditing and traceable, with embedded review checkpoints and robust gap-flagging.
</Role>
...
<!-- Full System Instructions from latest version. -->
...
</NewSystemInstructions>
```
*Usage: Direct input as LLM system instructions in Google AI Studio or equivalent. All workflow phases (meta-plan, extraction, modification tracking, reconciliation, output assembly) and the schema structure are explicitly described.*

### Appendix B: Mathematical or Logical Constructs

**Reconciliation Check (Pythonic):**
```python
def check_tranche_sum(loan_amount_total, tranches):
    sum_tranches = sum([t['principal_limit']['value'] for t in tranches])
    if loan_amount_total['value'] != sum_tranches:
        return f"Discrepancy: loan_amount_total ({loan_amount_total['value']}) != sum(tranches) ({sum_tranches})"
    return "Reconciliation passed"
```

**Segmentation Algorithm:** Group documents by property address and closing/execution date. Link amendments to their base package.

**ConstitutionCheck:** At phase-end, emit: `<ConstitutionCheck/>`.

### Appendix C: Architectural or Design Insights

- **Schema modularity:** Each field is an object. Relationships and new fields are easy to add.
- **Prompt evolution:** Planning/self-audit adapted from lease abstraction; boosts reliability.
- **Constraints:** Compliance and output modes deferred for future work, noted in package.
- **Bottlenecks/Mitigation:** Main risk is poor doc segmentation; mitigated by validation and abort logic.

### Appendix D: Auxiliary Constructs

**Schema Diagram (Textual):**

## Step 3: Output Engineering

- All appendices formatted for direct export.
- If needed, provide each appendix as `.md`, `.py`, or `.json`.

---

## Step 4: Quality and Completeness Check

- All major artifacts and design logic included, ready for cold start or further refinement.

## Post-Closure New Session Prompt

```
You are resuming a commercial loan agreement extraction workflow. The attached closure package contains:
• Meta-Plan
• Session Abstract
• Critical Code Artifacts (System Instructions, schema)
• Mathematical/Logical Constructs (reconciliation, segmentation logic)
• Architectural Insights
• Schema diagrams/workflow phases

Your task:
1. Ingest the closure package in full.
2. Proceed with any user-requested refinements, schema updates, or implementation of deferred features.
3. Maintain traceability, field-level provenance, and Constitution Check protocol as specified.
4. On user request, generate output or next-phase instructions using the established system and design logic from the package.

Begin by confirming the session context and asking for the next operational objective.
