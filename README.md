# Loan Agreement OCR Processing System

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains a Python-based OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system designed to extract and process information from loan agreement documents. The system uses advanced OCR techniques to digitize and analyze loan documents, extracting key financial data and terms.

## 🔒 Data Security & Privacy

**Important**: This repository does NOT contain actual loan documents or sensitive financial data. All PDF files and processed results are excluded via `.gitignore` for privacy and security reasons.

### Data Handling Strategy:
- **Large PDF Files**: Stored locally only, not committed to version control
- **Processed Results**: Generated locally, excluded from repository
- **Logs**: Contain processing information only, excluded for privacy
- **Sample Data**: Use anonymized/synthetic data for testing

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OCR libraries (Tesseract, etc.)
- PDF processing capabilities
- Sufficient local storage for large PDF files

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/melanson633/loan-ocr.git
   cd loan-ocr
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Follow the dependency setup guide:**
   ```bash
   # See DEPENDENCY_SETUP_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions
   ```

4. **Prepare your data:**
   - Place PDF files in `data_input/` directory
   - Ensure proper file permissions and access rights
   - Review configuration files in `config/` directory

## 📁 Data Structure

### Input Data Format
The system expects PDF loan documents in the `data_input/` directory. Supported formats:
- Standard loan agreements
- Promissory notes
- Modification agreements
- Amendment documents

### Output Data Structure
Processed results are generated in:
- `data_output/`: Structured data extractions
- `extraction_results/`: Analysis and summaries
- `logs/`: Processing logs and debugging information

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Multi-format PDF Processing**: Handles various loan document types
- **Intelligent Text Extraction**: Advanced OCR with error correction
- **Data Validation**: Ensures accuracy of extracted information
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple documents efficiently
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed processing logs for debugging

## 📊 Processing Workflow

1. **Document Ingestion**: Load PDF files from input directory
2. **OCR Processing**: Extract text using advanced OCR techniques
3. **Data Parsing**: Identify and extract key loan terms
4. **Validation**: Verify extracted data accuracy
5. **Output Generation**: Create structured data files
6. **Logging**: Record processing details and any issues

## 🔧 Configuration

Key configuration files:
- `config/`: Contains processing parameters and settings
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies
- `DEPENDENCY_SETUP_GUIDE.md`: Detailed setup instructions

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Large File Handling**: Optimized for processing large PDF documents
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage for batch processing
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time processing status updates

## 🤝 Contributing
